# MNIST Image Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains code for a simple image classification model using TensorFlow and the MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/mnist-tensorflow.git](https://github.com/el-nemaisy/mnist-image-dataset)
   cd mnist-tensorflow

### Model Training

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset with a simple neural network architecture.

### Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and accuracy metrics are reported.

### Acknowledgments

The MNIST dataset is used for educational purposes and can be accessed through TensorFlow's Keras API.
